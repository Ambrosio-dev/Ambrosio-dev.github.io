PROJECT: Creating a Video Game Demo/Prototype (D/E/A/T/H) 

Team: 
Milo Stickle-Frizzell


Objectives:

The primary goal of this project is to create a market ready slice of a video game that can be used for the purposes of marketing and player feedback. This will serve as base for further developments, but will exist as a cohesive and finished piece of software. 

I intend to shop around my work I produce to publishers as I gain more skill. This will serve as my first attempt to create a marketable work that can attract the eye of a publisher.

The demo itself will encompass the first act of the story, or “level” as you might call it. I estimate currently it will be 45 minutes to 1 hour in length.

The title of this project is currently D/E/A/T/H.

Background:

This is an unconventional project. I feel the need to highlight my background to show I’m not messing around and intend to deliver, rather than fumbling around for the semester. 
I have already produced multiple games. 
EXTENDED CARE UNIT ROOM 19B was a project I produced for UA Epscor’s Solstice Fire and Ice Game Jam this past summer. It was produced using many of the same tools I am using now, but I lacked experience at the time. However,  the judges evaluated my work and awarded me first place. 
four stories COVID is an educational interactive narrative I produced last semester with workers from DHSS AK for use in their AYVA project which is launching later this month statewide. This game was produced using Twine/HTML/CSS/JS.
I have also taken an independent study with Kenrick Mock where I taught myself many of these fundamentals and experimented in a variety of languages including Python and the Pygame library. 
I already have two websites which host my projects/portfolio. It has direct links to everything I have mentioned above.

Why This Project is More than CSCE:

As mentioned in the first class for this course, this project is intended to serve a cumulative statement of what we have learned as students. 

While the majority of this project will be focused on software fundamentals including programming, designing, documenting, and communicating, there will be more than CSCE involved. Namely, the creation of art assets. 

I am earning two degrees currently, and this is my final semester. My first degree is Computer Science, but my second is Art. As such this project serves as the culmination of both of these degrees, allowing me to produce a work that requires me to push my boundaries as both a developer and an artist.  

Current Status:

I have already started the development on this project. This includes:
Pre-production designing the aesthetic and sketching some visual designs
Outlining the narrative for the entire game, and a more detailed and specific outline of the section encompassed by the demo. This includes some scenes which have already been written.
A prototype featuring a menu, and two semi-playable sequences from the very beginning of the game that serve as a proof of concept. 
An online repository which I have been uploading the prototype to as I have worked on it over the past week. I anticipated using this as my project for this course and have already started including detailed comments on what is added in each commit. 
This repository is private, because I don’t want to share the source code with the public, but you can access it on Github by letting me share it with your profile.

I have included screenshots from the prototype below. I can also provide you with an executable of my work if needed so you don’t have to acquire a copy of the software and its license.

Much of what is below is very very early development, as such I am using some placeholder assets:

Functional Title Screen:

Visual Novel Segment with Selectable Options:

Controllable Ship/Shooter Section with Basic Moves Programmed:



Tools: 

The project is currently being developed with the following tools. I anticipate these are all I will need for the semester:
Game engine (Gamemaker Studio 2 IDE, GML programming language)
Libraries and public resources relating to GML and its IDE (Marketplace, Forums)
Various other software for creating assets (Procreate, Pixelator, Photoshop, MS Paint)
Various office software for creating design documents, script, etc. (Google Drive)
Repository software(Github, Git)
Website software for hosting (Github Pages, Itch.io, HTML/CSS/JS)


Outline:

This application will be split into sections. However, I mean this in two ways…

Firstly, the project has four main forms of interaction. These are as follows:
Visual novel sequences which express story and dialogue explicitly to the player (VN)
Spaceship shooter sequences which require more complex programming and designing but allow for deeper player engagement (S)
Adventure sequences, where the player will navigate an environment and solve puzzles (A)
Technical/Other aspects such as keybinding, menus, etc. (T)

Secondly this project is split into segments which express a linear narrative and game mechanics. The overall project will contain 5 sections, each with their own content. These will be unified by the core forms of interaction listed above, building upon what I plan to establish in this course. The content that is planned for production in this demo is listed below. The categories next to them describe which type of content they are:

Splash Screens (T)
Retro Title Screen/ Alt Title Screen (T)
Interview (VN)
Intro Cutscene (N/A)
Tutorial Arcade (S)
Tutorial Adventure/ Office (A)
Coworker / Elevator (VN)
Combat Elevator (S)
Adventure Shop (A)
Chase Sequence (S)
Adventure Shop Part 2 (A)
Chase Sequence 2 (S)
Boss Fight Coworker (S)
Path to Reflection (A)
Reflection (S)
Void 1 (VN)
Dream 1 (VN)
Office Tutorial (again?) (A)
Elevator (Again?) (VN)


While the majority of content has been thoroughly sectionalized above, there will likely be some VN sequences added in between some listed elements. In addition, some content towards the end of the demo may be shaved off for the sake of limiting scope and ensuring the product meets its deadline. I have included enough that some could be removed for the sake of time without damaging the work as a whole.

Implementation:

The majority of this game will be coded in the language GML which exists within the IDE Gamemaker Studio 2. This language requires the knowledge of basic programming skills to interface. And further requires intermediate programming skill to interface with some of its deeper features, including data structures. As such, I will be using the knowledge provided to me over the course of my Computer Science education to implement various features. 

Creating each category of feature as listed previously requires me to do the following:

Craft “rooms” for each section listed in the outlines. Some of these sections will be larger and will encompass more than one room. A room is a space in Gamemaker in which objects can function. While traditionally it is a literal room the player inhabits this does not have to be the case. It is a space in which objects work together. 
An example of a room in the prototype:
Craft “objects” to perform in the given environment. Objects in gamemaker are kind of like the objects you’d see in a regular OOP language, but they’re built into the interface. You write various snippets of code within them that tell the object how to behave, where to be, and which assets to grab.
An example of an object in the prototype:
Craft “assets” for each section of the game. These range from art to music. I will be producing all of the art myself during this project. However, I am not musically inclined and will be using placeholder music both for the sake of time, and also because I plan to hire a composer down the line.
An example of an asset in the prototype: 
Craft “scripts'' and “shaders” as tools. These are basically little snippets of code that don’t work inside an object, or you create as a means of reducing redundancy. They perform very specific functions, usually discovered in the midst of development. 
An example of a shader in the prototype: 

The above elements compile into a game within the Gamemaker 2 engine. 


Design Documents:

Besides what has been listed in the rest of this document, there is currently an in-development folder for D/E/A/T/H design documents. Some of them are out of date, but others have specific descriptions relating to the narrative, game design structure, and other such element:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10GqdOI8pMU10aX8hrJAeGLOMlhzjE9jb?usp=sharing

As the semester progresses, and development ramps up this folder will grow in size, and the documents will be continued to be filled out in further detail. However, currently the rough outline for the entire game (and various previous versions of it) are present.

Due to wanting to maintain privacy of the documents you will need to request access to your account for the drive folder and files via the link above.


Testing Plan & Debugging:

The project currently has a debug room setup that it loads into prior to entering into any other space. This room has preprogrammed variables which inputs are assigned to globally so they are not hard coded, and can be easily remapped later. 

This room will serve as the primary testing hub for this project. Testing will be done thrice:

Initial Testing (Test as You Go~!) [Unit]
Testing will be implemented as the project is developed
As features are added, the game will be “built” and features will be tested manually for functionality
This will occur by sliding out which room is currently structured to be next in the game below the debug room. 
Upon proving functional, features will be glossed over until later in development for further testing
Additionally, testing will make use of the Debug option present in the Gamemaker software which allows for additional error detection and monitoring hardware for irregularities caused by software.
Secondary Testing  [Integrative]
When all features in a section (as defined by the outline) have been completed a round of testing using both forms of debug will occur manually ensuring that all features are behaving appropriately.
If a bug is deemed minor, but is ignored for the purposes of scheduling it will be passed onto the third stage of testing.
Final Testing [System]
When all sections are complete the software will be tested for any outlying irregularities as previously mentioned, in addition to its cohesive functionality with all features and sections compiled. 
This stage of testing will involve some form of non-manual testing for specific sections to ensure they are behaving appropriately without constant iterative and perutative play. 
Extra Final Testing [System]
Evaluation of the product after it has been compiled and created as an executable. This will ensure that there are no hiccups in the transition (there shouldn’t be).

The debug room is planned to contain the following features, and will developed in tandem with the rest of the project: 
Key/input remapping
Level selection
Objects solely for the purpose of testing (these will include variables which may not exist in the currently tested room because they were to be inherited from another room or feature that is not currently being tested)
Performance evaluation

The debug room will be removed from its position in the level hierarchy after completion, but will still exist in the code.

A Disclosure Relating to Mature Content:

This project will contain mature content. If it were to be rated by the ESRB it would likely earn an M rating. However, the intention of the content is not to be gratuitous or pornographic in nature, but rather to accomplish two goals: 

To authentically immerse the player in the game and produce emotional responses.
To bring uncomfortable subject matter to light for the sake of ethical discussion and hopeful social change.

The content in question will contain, some violence, sexuality, and drug use. However, the majority of the maturity will come from the subject at hand (IE the use of mature themes) rather than lots of gore/nudity. 

If this project is produced to completion part of the proceeds will go to charity relating to the themes of the work. I am personally very passionate about the subjects and see this game as an avenue to elevate their discussion in an environment where they may not be normally seen.

A Disclosure Relating to Scope:

While this project is intended to encompass the first fifth of the game in demo form, I do intend to intentionally leave out some elements for the sake of scope. I intend to have at least one animated cutscene in this portion of the game, and pay various musicians to produce vocal and instrumental tracks. However, these features will not be implemented over the course of this class. Instead, placeholders (almost entirely relating to music) will be used in these instances.

As stated previously... In addition, some content towards the end of the demo may be shaved off for the sake of limiting scope and ensuring the product meets its deadline. I have included enough that some could be removed for the sake of time without damaging the work as a whole.
